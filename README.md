# UniversityProjects
## Each branch represents a different project:
 ### 1 - Computer Architecture 
 I simulated how a computer works using java where I represent the cycles and how they work from instruction fetching to execution to result storing
 ### 2 - Databases 
 this was a project, where I simulated how a database engine works using Java and created different types of indices
 ### 3 - Mirco Processors 
 In this project, I simulated how a processor handles instructions and handles stalls between instructions, it simulates a fully functional processor
 ### 4 - Artificial Intelligence 
 In this project, I've created an AI where the goal is to finish a game in the least amount of steps possible, using different algorithms and different scoring methods
